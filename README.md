# tester-portfolio-plan
This is a plan I created to build my portfolio and get my first testing job.

As an aspiring software tester, I applied to almost 50 positions in April'22 alone, but received 20 rejections and 0 interview invitations ðŸ˜•. So I decided to change my tactics and create a portfolio of projects that will help me showcase (and improve) my testing skills. I am also kinda new to GitHub so I hope to get more familiar with the platform as well. 

My current background (as of 02/05/2022): 
- some understanding of testing theory and methodology (books and online lessons)
- very basic SQL (MySQL, SQLite) - solved a couple problems from here: https://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_list/sql
- some understanding of API & REST protocol, played a little with Postman 
- very basic HTML/CSS/JS - completed several modules of https://www.freecodecamp.org/ web-development course, but didn't really like JS
- very basic Python skills - again, through some online courses, would love to continue learning it
- OS Linux: installed Ubuntu via VM box and later on my PC, currently learning basic user skills

It was my choice not to attend any software testing courses available in Russia, because:
1. None of them is universally recognized as quality one (no industry standard)
2. From my understanding, many of them are just spoon-feeding their students the information and don't help them develop their thinking. As a software tester, you are supposed to solve problems you've never encountered before, figure things out and learn on your own, so I don't see how this approach of most courses is helpful. 

Hopefully, this plan will help me to achieve my goal of getting my first testing job. And I'd be happy if other aspiring testers find it useful.
