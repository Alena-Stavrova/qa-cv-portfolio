Here is the plan itself 

1. Test Plan Project ‚ùì
I will develop a plan for some non-IT "technology", something like a "testing a pencil" excercise, but more fun. I have an idea for it, but it will remain a secret until the project is ready.

2. Test Case Project (web) üñ•Ô∏è
I will write test cases (and possibly test plan again) for a website or a program created specifically for testing purposes. I'm considering Listboxer, but maybe I'll find something more interesting and new.

3. Test Case Project (mobile) üì±
I will write test cases (and possibly test plan again) for a mobile app. Currently, I have zero knowledge on mobile testing, so I will need to learn some fundamentals. For the app, I'm thinking a shopping list - it is a super simple and minimalist app I personally use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minhtinh.grocerylistapp

4. Accessibility Testing Project üí¨
This was recommended as a way to get some practical testing experience, help a good cause and learn about the accessibility testing (I know nothing about it as well). I think it is a great idea, but I'll need to do some research on how to do it.

5. Start a testing blog ‚úçÔ∏è
I hope that by the time I complete Projects 1-4, I'll have some ideas for the content. I really enjoy writing, and it has been a big part of my professional life as well. I'm considering Medium as a platform.

6. Additional ideas to consider üí°
- using Jira and/or Asana in some of the projects (if not, include another project with them)
- SQL project
- API testing project through API playgrounds
- Python coding project (heard that Codewars can be fun)
