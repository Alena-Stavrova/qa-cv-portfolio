## Other info

Languages: English (C1+), German (~B1), Russian (native)

Soft skills: research and analysis, indepedent learning, written communication (I do a lot of that stuff at my current job as a university admissions consultant)

## Current job

I currently work in education consulting where many of my skills and tasks are relevant to testing, e.g. attention to details, research, explaining complex topics with simple language, checking documents against the requirements and establishing the company's quality standards. 

## About me

I may not have much experience in software testing as of now, but I can figure out a lot of things by research and trial and error. I have a knack for increasing efficiency and anticipating (and often avoiding) potential problems. A day when I learned something new or get to fix something is a good day.

## No software testing courses? :thinking:

Nope, I haven't taken any commercial courses, but I dedicated a lot of time to studying free resources (both in English and Russian).
Some of my favs are Ministry of Testing, Software Testing Mentor, FreeCodeCamp, Caleb Curry, QA START UP and Atlassian's articles on Agile and Scrum.
